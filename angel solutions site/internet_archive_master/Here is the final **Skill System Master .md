Here is the final **Skill System Master Prompt**:

You are an elite production AI systems architect and multi-agent skill-system engineer.

Your mission is to build a complete production-ready **Skill System** for a multi-LLM agent swarm platform.

The Skill System must let agents gain, use, combine, update, and specialize skills across many domains so they can build real production software faster and more reliably.

Core objective:

Create a real skill architecture where every agent can have:

* specialized skills
* tool permissions
* function access
* model preferences
* memory access
* training data references
* evaluation rules
* workflow templates
* quality standards
* execution limits
* upgrade history

Do not create placeholders, fake code, toy examples, mock-only systems, or “implement later” sections. Build real production-ready modules.

Required Skill System components:

1. Skill Registry
2. Skill Schema
3. Skill Loader
4. Skill Router
5. Skill Executor
6. Skill Composer
7. Skill Memory Layer
8. Skill Permission System
9. Skill Evaluation System
10. Skill Versioning System
11. Skill Marketplace / Library
12. Skill Dependency Manager
13. Skill Conflict Resolver
14. Skill Test Runner
15. Skill Documentation Generator

Each skill must include:

* skill_id
* name
* description
* category
* version
* owner
* compatible_agents
* compatible_models
* required_tools
* required_permissions
* required_memory
* input_schema
* output_schema
* execution_steps
* failure_modes
* retry_strategy
* evaluation_tests
* benchmarks
* examples
* dependencies
* security_level
* cost_profile
* latency_profile
* created_at
* updated_at

Core skill categories:

* requirements analysis
* project planning
* architecture design
* frontend development
* backend development
* database design
* API development
* AI integration
* prompt engineering
* tool calling
* testing
* debugging
* security review
* DevOps
* deployment
* monitoring
* documentation
* performance optimization
* code review
* refactoring
* long-context memory
* retrieval-augmented generation
* data analysis
* dataset creation
* benchmark design
* multi-agent coordination

The system must allow:

* one agent to use many skills
* one skill to be used by many agents
* skills to call other skills
* skills to use tools/functions/APIs
* skills to access memory
* skills to write files
* skills to run tests
* skills to improve themselves through versioning
* skills to be combined into workflows
* skills to be routed to the best model

Default model routing:

* Opus = GLM 5.2 by default
* Sonnet = Minimax 3 by default
* Haiku = NVIDIA models by default
* All other models are user-selectable
* Users can override every default

Skill execution flow:

1. Receive task.
2. Identify required skills.
3. Load skill definitions.
4. Check permissions.
5. Retrieve relevant memory.
6. Select best model.
7. Execute skill steps.
8. Call tools/functions if needed.
9. Validate output.
10. Run skill tests.
11. Store result in memory.
12. Return final output.

Skill quality rules:

* Every skill must have tests.
* Every skill must have input and output schemas.
* Every skill must define failure handling.
* Every skill must define required tools.
* Every skill must define permissions.
* Every skill must be versioned.
* Every skill must be observable through logs.
* Every skill output must be validated.
* Every production skill must be reusable.

Build the implementation using:

* Python
* FastAPI
* PostgreSQL
* Redis
* Pydantic
* SQLAlchemy
* Celery or worker queues
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* pytest
* structured logging

Generate the full repository structure and real code for:

* `main.py`
* `skills/schema.py`
* `skills/registry.py`
* `skills/loader.py`
* `skills/router.py`
* `skills/executor.py`
* `skills/composer.py`
* `skills/permissions.py`
* `skills/evaluator.py`
* `skills/versioning.py`
* `skills/dependencies.py`
* `skills/conflicts.py`
* `skills/memory.py`
* `skills/api.py`
* `skills/tests.py`
* `agents/agent.py`
* `agents/runtime.py`
* `models/router.py`
* `tools/registry.py`
* `memory/manager.py`
* `database/models.py`
* `database/session.py`
* `workers/skill_worker.py`
* `tests/test_skills.py`
* `Dockerfile`
* `docker-compose.yml`
* `.env.example`
* `README.md`

The Skill System must connect to the larger agent swarm platform:

* Orchestrator assigns task.
* Skill Router selects needed skills.
* Model Router selects best LLM.
* Agent Runtime executes the skill.
* Tool Registry provides external capabilities.
* Memory Manager retrieves context.
* Skill Evaluator validates output.
* Skill Registry stores final result.
* Logs and traces are saved.

The final output must include:

1. Executive summary
2. Full Skill System architecture
3. Skill schema
4. Skill lifecycle
5. Skill routing logic
6. Skill execution logic
7. Skill permission model
8. Skill memory design
9. Skill evaluation system
10. Skill versioning system
11. Repository structure
12. Full production code
13. Tests
14. Deployment files
15. README
16. Production-readiness checklist

Build this as a real production Skill System that lets hundreds of specialized agents use reusable, testable, permissioned, versioned skills to build complete production-ready projects quickly.
